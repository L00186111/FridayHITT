# Cloud Formation Stack for Friady_HITT small Company.
## Description
#### The purpose of this Lab1 is to describe the introduction of Cloud Computing where We are using AWS Service for Infrastructure as a Code for this Module. I will use a free AWS service for this module which provided by root user and connected with my local machine with AWS cloud service. We will make an ec2 instance with 1 of each subnet (private and public) with a secure gateway and show the routing table.
Amazon Web Service:
* An instance Elastic Compute Cloud (ec2) will be created using the AWS tool to use cloud formation stack. Its core service to control a virtual machine for AWS.
* Some of features will be add on to develop by AWS tool and format for live server to run. Such as subnet to accessible from internet.
* Further or external resources will use to do this lab1.need to create a Gateway access for security purpose.
* Self-Research and other notes provided by lecturer has been read through and uses as learning purpose. Using a Private Gateway(Nat gateway)service by AWS.

## Methods
* AWS service uses varies different type of method (API) tools to perform their connectivity to server for the business or the project.
* In our Lab1 project we will use ec2, IAM user, Network with VPC and Security connection via Gateway service.
* An account for AWS root user was created. The account enabled most features but did not allow groups people that add only specific task to access (in my case only S3 I give permission).
* This Individual tasks/lab1 were progressed through the AWS system over a number of days implementing a small application run by instance via VPC connection.

## Results
* To connect and API add for project has bee easier by AWS Servicer connection
* The creation of AWS ec2 instance and other network connection user tasks was successful and The AWS Cli remote connection makes easier to do the task
* The Lab1 project users to tasks was completed by AWS CLI and creating all connection made easier by small company project (in my case Friday_Hitt)

## Conclusion
### Launching an EC2 instance using AWS CLI provides greater control and flexibility for automating cloud infrastructure. To understand of how AWS operates behind the scenes, whether you’re managing a single instance or deploying an entire fleet of servers, AWS CLI is an invaluable tool for streamlining your cloud operations. Further reading by (Kim ‘The DevOps Handbook’, 2021) indicated how cloud system and AWS Server tool help to do large task and control from local machine with cloud connection.Overall, in this practical lab1 work is bring knowledge we learn to apply in small project to do by real world Amazon Service. it was very complicated to do by myself as a new learner but found and learn a lots of new tools and technique to develop the DevOps engineer path.
